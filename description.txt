Dragonite's Mod adds 2 magic bows and 2 new magic staffs, as well as a drop from the Twins' boss bag that gives an upgrade item.

Also made Twins' boss bag craftable using high end items.

Also added a Cheatcode to automatically give you any item you know the filename for.

/Item <name>

TwinsBossBag - Twins' Treasure Bag
adrienbow1 - Adrien's Damaged Bow
adrienstaff1 - Adrien's Damaged Staff
AdrieniteBar - Adrienite Bar
(and theres the post-moonlord bow and staff: just use 2 instead of 1)






Future Releases:
1 Boss - Drops Upgrade Item to make some of said items more powerful than some celestial items. (If I can figure out how)
1 Summon (If I can figure out how.)
